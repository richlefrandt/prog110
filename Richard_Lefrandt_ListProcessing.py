#List Processing

"""program that computes asks the user for a set of integer numbers,
and does some processing on them.
"""

"""Write a program that prompts the user for integer number,
and using a while loop,
continues to prompt until user enters a 0.
--Program should store the numbers in a list.
It then calculates and prints the total and average of the numbers using a for-loop.
--Next it prompts the user for a number to be replaced in the list,
and prompts for the new number
that should replace that old number.
--Next it prints the list before replacing the number.
--It then replaces all instances of the old number in the list
with the new number, and prints the replaced list.
--Next it sorts the list, and prints the sorted list.
-Next it finds and prints the maximum number of the list.
